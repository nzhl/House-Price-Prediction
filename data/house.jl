Every home features a continuous air and heat seal around the core of a timber framed structure. They come with mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system, air-source hot water heating, LED lighting and triple glazing to produce a eco home based on the German 'Passivhaus' model. Dale Road is the future of home design and construction. Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery Dale Road follows the most stringent Building Regulations specifications for air-tightness and heating, based on the German 'Passivhaus' model. The home requires only 10% of the heating needed to warm a typical house in the UK, because its so well insulated. The mechanical ventilation system provides a constant supply of clean, fresh air that is vital for the health and wellbeing of the household. \"Its a strange sensation when you first walk into a Positive Home in the winter. The home is lovely and warm - but the air is so clean and fresh, like a spring day. Only then do you realise how a typical home trades comfort for warmth, because all the radiators blasting away dries the air so much. Its beautiful!\" Martin Valentine, Positive Homes Managing Director. Hot water - heated by the air! At the heart of the home is a unique hot water tank system. This is linked to the ventilation system to use warmth from the air to heat water. This incredibly efficient system means its cheaper than gas to heat your water - and better for the planet too. Triple glazing Every window is triple glazed. This means there is less heat loss from inside - but also a big reduction in noise pollution from the outside. Because the home has mechanical ventilation, the windows do not need air vents - reducing drafts and heat loss even further. About positive homes \"We think and act differently to other house builders. It's not enough just to create new, super-energy efficient, sensibly priced homes. Our plan is to make sure the local economy and local communities benefit from every house we build. We buy materials from local suppliers, and will use local trades people wherever we can. So when you buy a Positive Home, you're not just investing in your family's future - you're investing in the next generation.\" Martin Valentine, Managing Director Lounge (4.66m (15' 3\") x 3.40m (11' 2\")) Kitchen/Diner (4.66m (15' 3\") x 2.98m (9' 9\")) Entrance Hall Study (3.06m (10' 0\") x 2.18m (7' 2\")) Downstairs WC Utility (1.74m (5' 9\") x 1.68m (5' 6\")) Bedroom 1 (4.66m (15' 3\") x 2.98m (9' 9\")) En-Suite Bathroom (3.06m (10' 0\") x 1.78m (5' 10\")) Bedroom 2 (3.30m (10' 10\") x 3.10m (10' 2\")) Bedroom 3 (4.66m (15' 3\") x 2.32m (7' 7\")) Bedroom 4 (4.66m (15' 3\") x 3.00m (9' 10\"))  ", "overall_rating": 67.0, "cs_rating": 70.0, "en_rating": 50.0, "pr_rating": 70.0, "rs_rating": 60.0, "sp_rating": 80.0, "tt_rating": 80.0, "demographic": [17.23, 10.98, 10.38, 13.0, 15.26, 12.51, 20.66], "education": [79.0, 23.0, 66.1, 94.3, 90.7], "crime": [12.61, 4.89, 4.46, 0.77, 1.9, 0.24, 10.62, 3.43], "counciltax": [1203.0, 1403.0, 1603.0, 1804.0, 2205.0, 2605.0, 3006.0, 3608.0], "housing": [169.0, 126.0, 64.0, 17.0, 60.0], "employment": [150.0, 134.0, 108.0, 150.0, 81.0, 25.0, 66.0], "family": [133.0, 120.0, 54.0, 127.0, 6.0, 66.0, 68.0], "newspapers": [143.0, 223.0, 17.0, 202.0, 16.0, 18.0, 15.0, 69.0], "interests": [65.0, 97.0, 106.0, 103.0, 57.0, 119.0, 103.0, 124.0]}

The property has a lounge and kitchen with one double bedroom and a spacious bathroom. There are 17 acres of communal gardens and parking areas to the development and the property is sold with no upward chain Accommodation This is a self-contained one bedroom flat within the conversion of the prestigious Hine Hall development which is sold with no upward chain.

You enter the property via a glazed panelled door to a living room, which has Parquet flooring and a window to the front elevation and two electric wall mounted heaters. An archway in turn provides access to the kitchen. The kitchen has a range of base and eye level units with an integrated oven and hob.

A panelled door in turn leads to an inner lobby where there are doors to the bedroom and bathroom and a further door providing access to an airing cupboard which also has provision and plumbing for an automatic washing machine.

A well presented 3 bedroom detached house with three bathrooms and open plan living area comprising of dining room and family room, complemented by two reception rooms and modern kitchen. There is a superb enclosed rear garden and a block paved forecourt provides off street parking. Accommodation This is an example of a well presented, extended three bedroom detached family home with a bathroom and two shower rooms. The property in question has versatile accommodation with plenty of reception space and an open plan living area comprising dining room and family room. To the first floor, in addition to the bathroom and shower room, there are three well proportioned bedrooms and given the location of the property, close to plentiful amenities including shops, supermarkets and restaurants plus transport links, we would strongly recommend an internal inspection as we do not believe it will be on the market for long. You enter the property into a storm porch which protects the main entrance from the elements, a door leads into the entrance hall. There is a staircase leading to the first floor accommodation with useful storage cupboard below. From the entrance hall glazed panelled doors lead to the lounge, sitting room and kitchen. The lounge is pleasantly decorated and has a walk-in bay window, glazed timber bi-fold doors provide access to the sitting room which is also pleasantly decorated with coving to the ceiling and superb feature fireplace with raised marble hearth and inset hot coal effect living flame effect gas fire set to a timber surround. From the sitting room timber glazed bi-fold doors lead to the family room. It is worth mentioning that both sets of bi-fold doors can be opened to create a larger open plan living area, perfect for family gatherings and entertaining. The kitchen which has been fitted with a modern range of base and eye level units with contrasting timber effect laminate working surfaces and tiled splashbacks plus inset stainless steel sink with chrome mixer tap. There is a space for a range cooker with included extractor fan above. In addition there is also space for an American style fridge freezer. It is worth noting that these appliances can be negotiated with the vendor separately. A door leads to a utility store where there is space for both an automatic washing machine and condensing dryer. Doors provide access to the front and rear outside areas including the garden. The open plan living area is l-shaped comprising a family room and dining area and has French doors leading to the rear garden and a door leads into the ground floor shower room comprising WC, washbasin and walk-in shower. To the first floor, the landing has panelled doors leading to all three bedrooms and the family bathroom plus shower room. Bedroom one is a good size room with walk-in bay window overlooking Avondale Road and a range of wardrobes. Bedroom two is a good size double room and is situated at the rear of the property. Bedroom three is a good size single room, currently housing a double bed and is situated to the front of the property with a window overlooking the elevation. The family bathroom has a white three piece suite comprising WC, pedestal sink and panelled p-shaped shower bath with shower off mixer tap. The room is complemented by part tiled walls and timber effect flooring provides low maintenance. In addition an opaque window provides natural light. Outside, the property has a block paved forecourt drive providing off road parking which in turn leads to the storm porch and utility store. The rear garden has an initial patio and the remaining is predominantly lawn with a few established shrubs and included sheds used for storage. In conclusion, we feel it would be an error to overlook this property, given the size and versatility of the accommodation on offer. It is worth noting that the property comes with the benefit of gas central heating and sealed unit double glazing throughout. With all these things in mind, we would strongly recommend an internal inspection as we do not believe the property will remain on the market for long.

The lounge has a bay window to the front elevation and a dado rail and a further door leads to the dining kitchen which has a range of Oak finish base and eye level units with room for a dining table and a window overlooking the rear garden. From the kitchen a panelled door leads to the bathroom which has a bath, pedestal washbasin, WC and additional shower enclosure with mains pressure shower and from the kitchen a further door leads to a lean-to/utility which has power and plumbing. To the first floor there are two doubles and a further single bedroom with the master bedroom being a larger than average size. The property comes with gas central heating and UPVC sealed unit double glazing and externally there is parking to the front elevation and lawned gardens to the front, side and rear. Given the proximity to Arnold\u2019s amenities and school catchment areas, we do feel the property would prove popular with both first time buyers and young families and therefore would urge an internal inspection.

The existing 4 bedroom house is exceptionally well presented and could also be extended. A drive provides parking for multiple cars with garaging which includes a large workshop. Accommodation This is a rare and fantastic opportunity to purchase an executive home and adjoining building plot, in a semi rural location adjacent to open farmland. The property is set back, along a gravelled drive providing privacy and parking for multiple vehicles. The extensive lawned rear garden includes a building plot with outline planning permission to build a single detached dwelling. The existing house is ideal for entertaining inside and out and has further development potential to enhance the already well presented family sized accommodation. We believe there to be space to build a four bedroom detached house which could be positioned on the plot in order to retain the existing detached workshop, or alternatively, a detached bungalow could be constructed if accommodation for a dependent relative is required. The main entrance to the property is protected by a feature open porch from where a solid hardwood door with side windows provides access to the entrance hall. The entrance hall is a fine introduction to this home with Oak floor, Oak veneered doors and an Oak and stainless steel staircase leading to the first floor accommodation. There\u2019s access to the cloakroom/WC and lounge whilst an opening leads to the dining kitchen. The spacious lounge has open access to the dining area and dual aspect windows overlooking both the front and side elevations with the focal point of the room being a modern wall mounted plasma gas fire. Also accessed from the lounge is a good size study enjoying views over the rear garden which could also be utilised as a further sitting room. The modern dining kitchen is fitted with a range of base and eye level units with granite worktops and has a quality range of Neff integrated appliances including a double electric fan assisted oven, five ring gas hob, stainless steel and glass extractor canopy and a concealed dishwasher. There is also space for a stacked fridge freezer and two sets of French doors overlook and provide access to the side sun terrace with seating area. Accessed from the kitchen is a second kitchen/utility which is also fitted with a modern range of units with solid timber work surfaces and also has a range of integrated Neff appliances including an electric fan assisted oven, four ring induction hob and stainless steel and glass extractor canopy. There is provision and plumbing for a washing machine, space for a tumble dryer and feature stainless steel splashbacks. All four bedrooms and the bathroom are accessed from the first floor landing and are all double in size with bedrooms one and two having in-built wardrobes to the over-stairs recess and bedroom three also enjoying a range of fitted storage. The fully tiled bathroom is fitted with a three piece white suite comprising dual flush WC, pedestal washbasin and bath with electric Mira shower. There is downlighting and a window provides plenty of natural light from the rear elevation. The property benefits from gas central heating, UPVC double glazing, PVC fascia and soffits and the reassurance of a burglar alarm system. Outside, extensive off-street parking is provided by a private drive leading to lock-up timber gates which open to further pebbled hardstanding for multiple vehicles. The property also enjoys the use of a detached timber garage with adjoining carport which has power and lighting as well as a substantial timber garage/workshop which has power and lighting and is situated at the end of the garden. The substantial rear garden is mainly lawned with a variety of established plants and shrubs set to border as well as a variety of decked and pebbled patio areas providing fantastic space for entertaining. To summarise, this is a unique opportunity to be able to build your own dream house within your own back garden whilst living in style, or to be able to have a property built for a dependent relative on your doorstep. Its semi rural location is ideally placed for the excellent amenities available within both Redhill and Arnold, as well as being within easy commuting distance of Nottingham city centre.

Built in 1839 and having been the Station Hotel during the reign of Queen Victoria, the property was divided into two large semi-detached homes. Occupying the larger portion, St Annes has superb rooms over three floors as well as a substantial ground floor addition and a huge double garage with access on both sides.
